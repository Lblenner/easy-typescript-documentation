# Easy-typescript-documentation

Generate documentation based on your typescript classes.  
I created this package because I had difficulties using [tsdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc) for my basic needs.


Check out [typescirpt-rest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript-rest) if you want to generate documentation for your API.  
If you need more functionnalities check out [tsdoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc).

The packages provides some pre-defined annotations, and functions to create your owns.

You can check [the documentation](www.google.com) (Generated with the getDocPage function).  
If you don't like the look, feel free to create your own layout based on the json generated by the getJson functions.

Github Repository.

Support for methods is coming.


# Quick Start

    npm i --save typescript easy-typescript-documentation

Set ```"experimentalDecorators": true``` in tsconfig.json

model.ts

    import {Doc, ClassName, ClassDesc, Name, Desc, Color, DOC_COLOR, Note} from "easy-typescript-documentation"

    @Doc
    @ClassName("My Object")
    @ClassDesc("Object with a name, a setter and a getter.")
    class myObject {

        constructor(name: string) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        @Name("Name")
        @Desc("This is a description")
        @Color(DOC_COLOR.ORANGE)
        @Note("This is a note")
        name: string;

    }

doc.ts

    import * as model from "./model"
    import { getDocPage, getJson } from "easy-typescript-documentation"

    //Returns a list of object representing each class in model.ts
    //You can use it to build your own UI. More infos in JSON structure
    const json = getJson(model)

    //Return an html page as a string that you can return from your api
    const name = "My documentation"
    const description = "Exemple documentation"
    const htmlPage = getDocPage(name, model, description)

Here is [the result]() with some more classes in model.ts

# JSON structure


# Create your own annotation

Note that getDocPage only work with the pre-defined annotations.
